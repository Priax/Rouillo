# Rouillo

This is a small puyo puyo game made in Rust.

I made this because my girlfriend and I love the game.

The rules are simple, just like tetris, you have small puyos of different colors that fall two by two.

You need to connect 4 puyos of the same color (try doing some combos !)

You can move the falling puyos using Q and D.
